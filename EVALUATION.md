# A Joint Evaluation of GEML

*English | [中文](EVALUATION_CN.md)*

> A design review of GEML by two reviewers from opposite ends of the markup world,
> with one question in front of us: **what would it take for us to recommend GEML
> in place of Markdown and HTML?**

## Who is reviewing, and why both

- **John MacFarlane** — author of **CommonMark**, **Djot**, and **Pandoc**. The
  lens here is markup-language design and *specification rigor*: is the grammar
  deterministic, is the spec normative, will two independent implementations
  agree, and does the format earn the claims it makes.
- **Thariq Shihipar** — engineering lead on Anthropic's Claude Code team and
  author of *"The Unreasonable Effectiveness of HTML."* The lens here is
  *agent output*: does this format help a model ship a better artifact to a
  human, and how does it fare against HTML on the axes — layout, color,
  interactivity, round-trip editing — where HTML has become the format agents
  reach for.

We were chosen as a pair on purpose. GEML sits exactly between our two worlds:
it wants Markdown's plain-text legibility *and* a rigor Markdown never had, while
deliberately refusing HTML's escape hatch. One of us cares whether the grammar is
sound; the other cares whether an agent and a browser can do anything useful with
it. A format that wins *only* one of those reviews does not get our recommendation.

---

## TL;DR — the verdict, and the one move that changes it

GEML is **the most thoughtfully designed plain-text format in its comparison
table**, and its three headline bets — one typed-block primitive, build-time
reference checking, and an AST-first document model — are the right instincts,
clearly descended from Djot and Pandoc.

But as it stands **neither of us would yet recommend it over Markdown or HTML**,
for two different reasons that happen to point the same way:

- **MacFarlane:** GEML claims "no syntax ambiguity," but it has not yet done the
  work that claim requires. Lists and emphasis are under-specified, the EBNF is a
  draft, and the only definition of the language is a single reference parser
  built on naive regexes. *A reference implementation is not a specification* —
  that is the entire lesson of CommonMark. Two conforming GEML parsers would
  disagree today.
- **Shihipar:** GEML bans the raw-HTML escape hatch *and* ships no renderer of
  its own. So on the exact axis my essay is about — a thing a human can open and
  *use* — GEML currently produces **nothing**. It is more restrictive than even
  Markdown there: a `.geml` file is something you read, not something you operate.

The single move that flips both verdicts is the same one, and it is best said in
GEML's own voice — as a positioning line GEML should put its name behind:

> **GEML is not a competing runtime to HTML. It is the typed, checkable *source*
> that compiles *into* HTML** — the very self-contained, interactive artifact you
> ask an agent to hand-write today, but produced from a small, verifiable model,
> with the cross-references already checked and the data kept in sync with its
> chart, and emitting Markdown and PDF from the same source.

That reframing turns "no raw HTML in the source" and "no renderer" from
liabilities into the *point* — portable, checkable semantics in; multiple rich
targets out. It is, not coincidentally, the Pandoc architecture. The rest of this
document is about what it takes to make that real.

---

## What "recommend over Markdown and HTML" actually requires

It is worth being explicit that "beat Markdown" and "beat HTML" are *different
axes that trade off against each other*:

| Axis | Markdown's position | HTML's position | What GEML must do |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Rigor / determinism** | weak (no single parse, fragmented) | n/a (a different game) | **beat Markdown:** one defined parse, a normative test suite |
| **Expressiveness / rendering** | a ceiling agents have outgrown | the runtime everyone has | **match HTML's output:** a great renderer/compiler |

Markdown is beaten on rigor; HTML is beaten only by *producing what HTML
produces*. A format that constrains hard enough to be checkable (the MacFarlane
win) tends to constrain away the visual richness (the Shihipar win), and vice
versa. **GEML can only win both axes if it stops trying to *be* the runtime and
becomes the checkable source that *compiles to* the runtime.** Hold that thought;
it is the spine of Part 4.

---

## Part 1 — What GEML already gets right

Credit where it is due, from both of us:

- **The single typed-block primitive is genuinely elegant.** `=== type {attrs}
  … ===` for code, tables, math, diagrams, callouts, and metadata is a real
  simplification over "a new syntax per feature, plus an HTML fallback." It is
  Djot's fenced-div instinct, generalized. For a model, one block shape to emit
  correctly means measurably fewer malformed-output branches than Markdown's pile
  of special cases.
- **Build-time reference checking is the feature to steal.** A dangling
  `[[#id]]`, a duplicate id, an unknown `{{meta}}` key, or a typo'd chart column
  is a hard diagnostic with a line number — not a silent 404 discovered three
  hops later. No light-markup format guarantees this. For an agent doing
  multi-file edits, it is the difference between a machine-checkable pass/fail and
  hope.
- **AST-first, with a document-model JSON and `diagnostics`.** Defining the
  format by its abstract model rather than its rendering is exactly right, and the
  structured pass/fail is precisely what a CI loop or a self-correcting agent
  wants to consume.
- **The attribute model is borrowed from the right place.** `{#id .class
  key=val}` with sane value typing comes straight from Djot / pandoc-markdown.
  Good lineage, good taste.
- **Tables and charts as a single source of truth.** A chart that reads a real
  table by `data=#id` — computed columns included — and errors on a missing
  column is the correct instinct: no data series silently drifting out of sync
  with its chart.
- **Restraint in the table language.** Explicitly excluding cell addressing,
  `VLOOKUP`, `remote()`, and embedded programs keeps tables a *document* feature
  rather than a spreadsheet engine. The instinct to draw that line is right (even
  though, below, we argue the line is drawn in an awkward place).

These are not small things. The disagreements that follow are the disagreements
you have with a serious design, not a careless one.

---

## Part 2 — John MacFarlane's evaluation: markup design & spec rigor

I want to start by saying GEML has my fingerprints on it in the best way — the
attribute syntax is Djot's, the AST orientation is Pandoc's, the
fewer-and-more-regular-constructs philosophy is the one I have been arguing for
since CommonMark. So read the following as notes from someone who wants this to
succeed and has made most of these mistakes himself.

### 2.1 The "no ambiguity" claim is not yet earned (the gating issue)

This is the heart of it. The README says "No syntax ambiguity"; §1 makes
determinism a constraint. But the document does not yet contain the machinery
that would *make* it true, and the reference parser actively contradicts it:

- **Lists are barely specified, and the parser cannot nest them.** Lists are the
  single hardest part of any Markdown-family grammar — nesting, indentation,
  loose vs. tight, ordered-list start numbers, lazy continuation. The spec gives
  them one EBNF line; the parser (`geml.ts`) matches list items with a flat regex
  and has no notion of nesting at all. This is precisely the corner where every
  Markdown implementation diverged for a decade.
- **Emphasis is specified at pre-CommonMark precision.** The rule "delimiters
  must attach to a non-space character" is necessary but nowhere near
  sufficient. The parser uses leftmost-regex matching, which will disagree with
  any other implementation on `*a **b* c**`, `**a*b**`, intraword emphasis, and
  every nested same-delimiter case. CommonMark needed the *delimiter-run /
  flanking* algorithm and roughly **130 emphasis examples** to pin this down to a
  single answer. GEML has neither the algorithm nor the examples.
- **Inline precedence is under-defined** at the seams — what exactly happens to
  `[text *with](url) emphasis*`? Link-versus-emphasis precedence needs a stated
  rule, not an implementation accident.

The fix is not more prose. It is the CommonMark discipline:

1. A **normative conformance suite** of input → document-model-JSON cases —
   hundreds, not 59 — where *the suite is the specification*. CommonMark's
   `spec.txt` carries ~650 runnable examples for a reason.
2. An **explicit, stated algorithm** for the two hard problems (list parsing and
   emphasis resolution), so an implementer reproduces the parse from the spec
   rather than from reading the TypeScript.
3. A frozen grammar with the "draft" removed from the EBNF.

**Acceptance test:** a *second, independent* implementation, written only from
the spec, agrees with the reference parser on the whole suite. Until that has
happened, "no ambiguity" is an aspiration, not a property — and it is the one
claim on which GEML's entire pitch against Markdown rests.

### 2.2 "One primitive" is partly a framing, and should be owned honestly

The block *frame* is uniform, but the block *body* is a different sublanguage per
type: a pipe-grid **or** CSV/TSV for tables; an external DSL for diagrams; LaTeX
for math; `key=val` for meta; verbatim for code; **plus** a genuine expression
language (`compute` / `summary`, with operator precedence, aggregates, and
`printf` specs — 400 lines in `table.ts`) living inside attribute strings.

So the real surface a human or a model must master is *one frame + N body
sublanguages + an attribute expression language*. That is arguably **more** total
surface than Markdown, merely organized more tidily. This is fine — but the
README's "one grammar to learn" is true only at the framing level, and the honest
version of the pitch is "**one uniform *frame*, so the structure is regular and
checkable," not "one grammar."

### 2.3 The formula DSL in a quoted attribute is a design smell

`compute="FY [%.1f] = Q1 + Q2 + Q3 + Q4; YoY [%.1f%%] = (FY - PriorFY) * 100 /
PriorFY"` buries a whole expression language — with its own lexer, parser,
precedence, `[printf]`, `;` separators, and *single*-quoted column names because
the attribute is *already* double-quoted — inside a string, inside an attribute,
inside a one-physical-line fence header. This violates the spirit of "fully
legible plain text." Org-mode, cited as the inspiration, at least keeps formulas
on their own `#+TBLFM:` line. Either lift computation onto its own body lines
where it is visible and diffable, or decide tables are a document feature and drop
computation. The half-measure — a spreadsheet smuggled into a string — is the
worst of both. (Thariq reaches the same conclusion from the generation side;
when both the parser-theory reviewer and the model-output reviewer independently
flag the same construct, it is worth listening.)

### 2.4 The fence model is clever but fragile

The "closing fence must be *exactly* the opening length, nest with *longer*
fences" rule, applied to a *single* delimiter character for *all* structure, has
two hazards:

- **Editing cascades.** Adding a deeper nested block can force you to lengthen
  every enclosing fence — a non-local edit.
- **It is decided by the deepest payload.** You cannot know the correct outer
  fence length until you have seen the innermost one. Your own history spec
  concedes this, routing deep payloads into separate `blob`s "because correct
  fence-length nesting is error-prone."

Two ways out, either acceptable: let the close fence be a run of `=` of **at
least** the opening length (so nesting never forces you to lengthen the outside),
or allow an optional **named / heredoc** close (`=== code … ===code`). Both keep
the close *local* and unambiguous.

### 2.5 Missing primitives for an "expressive" format

For something named *General Expressive*, three gaps stand out:

- **No inline spans.** Djot and Pandoc let you write `[a phrase]{.term}` to mark
  prose semantically inline. GEML has block-level classes but no inline
  equivalent, so a "semantic class, never a styling hook" philosophy cannot reach
  inside a sentence. Add bracketed spans.
- **No definition/description lists**, which are bread-and-butter for the
  technical and reference documents GEML is otherwise aimed at.
- **A closed, hardcoded type registry.** New block types are "warnings, kept
  raw," with no way to *declare* a new type's body mode and validation in-document
  or via a sidecar schema. So "one primitive for everything" hits a wall the
  moment an organization needs `=== requirement {#REQ-1}` with checked semantics:
  today that requires forking the processor. A declarable registry (a `===
  typedef`, or an external schema GEML validates against) is what lets the single
  primitive actually scale to "everything" without the core shipping every domain.

### 2.6 Interop is the lifeblood, and it is thin

Pandoc taught me that a format lives or dies by its converters. GEML ships a
*lossy* `md → geml` (it **drops thematic breaks** — silent data loss — and turns
raw HTML into text-with-a-note) and nothing in the other direction. There is no
`geml → html`, no `geml → markdown`, no bridge to a Pandoc-style AST. The tell is
in this very repository: the README's "renders as" examples are displayed by
**GitHub's Markdown/HTML renderer**, because GEML has no renderer of its own. A
format whose own showcase is rendered by translating away from it has not yet
closed the loop. Define GEML by its AST (it already nearly is) and write the
converters; that is also exactly the bridge of Part 4.

### 2.7 `.gemlhistory` is scope creep that dilutes the core

Reverse deltas + keyframes + SHA-256 + a bespoke `delete/replace/insert/move`
patch language reimplements a large slice of version control — with *weaker*
guarantees (the spec itself admits the id chain is "not cryptographically
tamper-evident"), no branching, destructive rollback, and a patch sublanguage the
spec says agents **must not** hand-write (which contradicts "fully legible,
AI-writable plain text"). The "without git" framing is weak: the target
users — developers and agents in repositories — overwhelmingly *have* git, which
already gives content-addressed, tamper-evident, branching history and an
enormous tool ecosystem. This is a lot of spec and parser surface for a narrow
git-less niche, and it competes for attention with the three ideas that are
actually differentiating. My advice: spin it out of the core pitch. Keep it only
if a crisp, explicit git-less audience is the goal, and stop counting it as a
core differentiator.

### 2.8 Confront the XML ghost, and the boundary of checking

Two honesty edits for the positioning:

- **"One uniform primitive for everything structured" was XML's pitch too.** The
  arc from XML to Markdown is the story of humans rejecting a uniform-but-rigid
  primitive in favor of lightweight, *special-cased*, ergonomic syntax. GEML is
  betting against that history; it should say *why* it won't share XML's fate
  (my own answer would be: because the special cases live in *body modes and a
  declarable registry*, not in the surface grammar — but GEML has to make that
  argument, not dodge it).
- **Be honest about where checking stops.** Reference-checking is real for *ids*
  but does not reach *content*: a malformed Mermaid or LaTeX body sails straight
  through, since the processor "MUST NOT interpret the body." That is a
  defensible boundary, but the README should state it, because "build-time
  checking" reads as stronger than it is.

---

## Part 3 — Thariq Shihipar's evaluation: agent output & the HTML lens

*The following is Thariq's assessment, integrated as the second voice in this
review.*

### 3.1 First reaction

My whole thesis is "stop asking Claude for walls of Markdown when the output
wants layout," so I read GEML through one question: *does this help an agent ship
a better artifact to a human?* My take is split. As a **source and interchange
format**, GEML is the most agent-legible thing in its comparison table — one
block shape, hard reference checking, structured tables that stay in text. But the
spec bans the raw-HTML escape hatch, says a conforming processor "MUST NOT depend
on raw HTML," and **ships no renderer.** So on the exact axis my essay is
about — visual richness, color, interactivity, a thing a human can *operate* —
GEML today produces nothing. A `.geml` file is something you *read*; a
self-contained `.html` file is something you *use*. Impressive as the layer
*under* the artifact; a non-starter as the artifact itself.

### 3.2 What GEML genuinely does well for agents

- **One uniform block primitive lowers the malformed-output rate.** Markdown's
  failure modes for models *are* the special cases — a table separator off by a
  pipe, a fence colliding with indentation, frontmatter that isn't quite YAML.
  Collapsing everything into `=== type {attrs}` is one grammar to emit correctly
  instead of a dozen. Fewer branches in the generator means fewer broken renders.
- **Build-time reference checking turns silent link-rot into an actionable
  error.** This is the feature I'd steal: an agent doing multi-file edits gets a
  machine-checkable diagnostic with a line number instead of a 404 discovered
  later. The document-model JSON with `diagnostics` is the structured signal a
  self-correcting loop wants.
- **Tables and charts as single source of truth**, and **everything stays in the
  text modality at low token cost** — a table is `| a | b |`, not a `<table>`
  tower — which also diffs cleanly line-by-line for patch-based editing.
- **Deterministic, low-ambiguity structure** (ATX-only headings, typed
  attributes) — less for a model to get subtly wrong, in principle. (John's Part 2
  is the asterisk on "in principle.")

### 3.3 Where GEML is worse than HTML for what my essay cares about

- **No canonical presentation and no universal runtime — so it is *more*
  restrictive than even Markdown.** My HTML argument rests on two legs: the
  browser is a runtime everyone already has, and HTML self-renders into something
  visual and interactive. GEML kicks both legs out. Ship a human a `.geml` with a
  Mermaid block and no toolchain and they get **literal DSL source in a fenced
  block**, not a diagram. Markdown-on-GitHub at least renders that Mermaid. GEML
  banned its only universal fallback and didn't replace it with a runtime.
- **No interactivity story at all.** The artifacts I celebrate — a working
  mini-editor, a planning board, an annotated PR view, a slide deck, side-by-side
  design comparisons in a grid — are *behavioral*. `.class` is "a semantic label,
  never a styling hook"; there are no events, no scripting, no layout primitives.
  GEML can describe a document's *structure* but never its *behavior*.
- **Cold-start fluency is a real, underrated problem.** HTML's unreasonable
  effectiveness *is* the training distribution — models are fluent with zero
  prompting. Models have seen approximately **zero GEML**. Until that changes,
  every generation needs the grammar carried in-context, and the model will drift
  toward Markdown habits and reach for the raw-HTML hatch that isn't there. This
  has to be **measured**, not asserted.
- **The single-`=` fence-length nesting rule is a generation footgun.** To nest,
  a model must track **global fence depth** and lengthen the *outer* fence — a
  non-local constraint it must plan *before* writing the opening fence. HTML's
  `<tag>`/`</tag>` is verbose but *local*: you never need to know how deep you are
  to close correctly. For an autoregressive model, locality beats brevity. (Your
  own history spec routes around this rule for being "error-prone" — when a
  companion spec avoids your rule, it's a hazard.)
- **The compute/summary DSL inside quoted attributes** stacks three
  quoting/escaping regimes in a place where a model sees a string, not structure —
  a plausible source of exactly the malformed output the single-primitive design
  is meant to eliminate.

### 3.4 The bridge, reacted to as Thariq

Here's the framing that flips me from skeptic to interested: **position GEML as
the typed, checkable *source* that compiles to the self-contained interactive
HTML artifact I already tell people to hand-ask Claude for.** The two bets were
never in conflict; they're different layers. The agent authors clean, low-token,
reference-checked GEML — and gets the malformed-output reduction, the hard error
on a broken link, the single-source-of-truth tables, the cheap diffs. A GEML
compiler emits the rich self-contained `.html` (real layout, color, rendered
diagrams, charts drawn from the table model, **interactivity**) and *also*
Markdown and PDF from the same source. "No raw HTML in the *source*" stops being a
restriction and becomes the *point*: portable, checkable semantics in, multiple
rich targets out. That is strictly better than asking a model to hand-author
2,000 lines of `<div>` soup and *hoping* the cross-references line up — because
right now **nothing checks that HTML.**

Two things this reframing must own. First, GEML's deliberately closed vocabulary
(semantic `.class` only, a fixed inline set, a closed chart-channel set) caps the
*ceiling* of the generated artifact — a compiler can only render affordances the
format can name. My favorite HTML artifacts use bespoke one-off interactions, so
GEML either grows a principled "interactive component" block type (escaping the
closed set *without* reopening the raw-HTML hatch) or concedes it targets the
structured-document 80%, not the bespoke-tool 20%. Fine scope — but state it.
Second, the compiler then **is** the runtime dependency GEML claimed not to need;
"no renderer" stops being a virtue the moment the value proposition is "it
compiles to a great artifact." Own that too.

### 3.5 My bar for recommending GEML over Markdown/HTML

Concrete and testable. I'd tell people to use GEML when it ships, demonstrably,
all of:

1. **An excellent `geml → self-contained-HTML` compiler, *with interactivity*** —
   single file, any browser, no server — producing at least the affordances my
   essay names (planning board, annotated diff view, slide deck,
   sortable/filterable table, side-by-side grid) *from GEML source*. This is the
   gating item; today it produces nothing.
2. **A handful of killer self-contained interactive artifacts authored as GEML**,
   shown next to the HTML a human would otherwise hand-ask for. If the compiled
   artifact isn't as good, the indirection isn't worth it.
3. **Demonstrated token efficiency vs. hand-HTML** on the *same* artifacts —
   source tokens and edit-patch tokens — with the compiler closing the visual gap.
   A measured number, not an intuition.
4. **Evidence current Claude models emit valid GEML** zero-shot or with a short
   system prompt / skill: run a fixture suite and report the **valid-parse rate**
   and **diagnostic-clean rate**, with the failure breakdown on the two footguns
   (fence depth, the formula DSL). High-90s valid-parse with a one-page skill and
   I believe the cold-start problem is tractable.
5. **Round-trip editing** — a human or model edits the rendered artifact and the
   change lands back in source without corruption.
6. **Renderer-availability honesty** — bundle the common diagram renderers into
   the default compiler so a `diagram` block becomes a *picture* out of the box,
   or stop implying diagrams "render."
7. **The reference-checking and table-as-source-of-truth guarantees survive
   compilation** into the HTML/PDF the human actually receives — the cross-checks
   are the differentiator; they can't evaporate in the artifact.

Bottom line: as a **rival runtime to HTML, GEML loses today.** As the **typed,
checkable source that compiles to the self-contained interactive HTML artifact I
already recommend**, it's the most compelling pitch in this review — and the one
place John's "constrain and check" bet and my "HTML effectiveness" bet point the
same direction. Ship items 1–4 and you won't have to convince me; the artifacts
will.

---

## Part 4 — The central tension, and the bridge we both endorse

We came in from opposite ends and converged on the same sentence. Here it is
jointly and plainly — and deliberately in the first person, because this is the
sentence GEML should lead with on its own homepage, not a recommendation we are
making *about* GEML:

> **GEML is not a competing runtime to HTML. It is the typed, checkable *source*
> that compiles *into* HTML — the very self-contained, interactive artifact you
> ask an agent to hand-write today, but produced from a small, verifiable model:
> the cross-references are already checked, the data and its chart are guaranteed
> in sync, and the same source emits Markdown and PDF besides. HTML is the
> destination; GEML is the source of truth that reaches it safely.**

This is the Pandoc architecture, and it is proven: define the format by its
abstract document model, then own the converters out of it. It dissolves the
tension in the two-axis table above. GEML beats Markdown on **rigor** (one defined
parse, a normative suite) *as a source language*, and it matches HTML on
**expressiveness** *by compiling to HTML* — without ever asking the source grammar
to grow event handlers or `<div>` soup. The agent reasons over a small, verifiable
tree; the human opens the rich result in the runtime they already have.

It also reframes GEML's two most contested decisions as features:

- **"No raw-HTML escape hatch"** stops being a restriction and becomes the
  guarantee that makes multi-target compilation and reference-checking *possible*.
  Raw HTML is precisely the thing that breaks portability to LaTeX, docx, and a
  checkable model — MacFarlane has spent fifteen years on exactly that problem in
  Pandoc.
- **"No renderer"** must now *invert*: the renderer becomes the headline
  deliverable, not an omission. The moment the pitch is "compiles to a great
  artifact," the compiler is the product.

The catch is equally plain: **none of this exists yet.** The bridge is a promise
until the compiler ships and is excellent. That is what the roadmap is for.

---

## Part 5 — A roadmap to "recommended"

Prioritized, with acceptance criteria. **P0 items are gating** — without them,
neither of us recommends GEML over the status quo.

### P0 — Make it true (the gates)

1. **Make the spec normative and deterministic.**
   - Ship a **conformance suite** of input → document-model-JSON cases (target
     several hundred), where *the suite is the spec*. Pin **list parsing** and
     **emphasis resolution** with an explicit, stated algorithm (the
     delimiter-run/flanking approach for emphasis; an indentation model for
     lists). Remove "draft" from the EBNF.
   - **Acceptance:** a *second, independent* implementation written only from the
     spec agrees with the reference parser across the entire suite.
2. **Ship the compiler: `geml → self-contained HTML`, plus `geml → markdown`.**
   - Single-file HTML, any browser, no server; diagrams and charts render to
     actual pictures (bundle Mermaid/Graphviz/D2); tables render with their
     computed columns; reference links resolve. Include at least basic
     interactivity (a sortable/filterable table is the minimum bar).
   - **Acceptance:** this repository's own "renders as" examples are produced by
     the GEML compiler, *not* by GitHub's Markdown renderer. A human with only a
     browser can open and use the output.
3. **Measure agent fluency, and publish it.**
   - Run current Claude models over a GEML fixture suite, zero-shot and with a
     one-page skill / system prompt. Report **valid-parse rate** and
     **diagnostic-clean rate**, with a failure breakdown isolating fence-depth
     nesting and the formula DSL.
   - **Acceptance:** high-90s valid-parse with a short skill. If a one-page skill
     can't get there, the format is fighting the training distribution and the P1
     footgun fixes become P0.

### P1 — Make it genuinely better than the alternatives

4. **Defuse the two footguns.** Relax the close fence to a run of `=` of **≥** the
   opening length (or add a named/heredoc close), and **lift compute/summary
   formulas out of quoted attribute strings** onto their own visible, diffable
   body lines.
5. **Add the expressiveness primitives a real authoring format needs:** inline
   spans `[text]{.class}`, definition lists, and a **declarable open type
   registry** (`=== typedef` or an external schema) so domains add *checked* block
   types without forking the processor.
6. **Round-trip editing:** edits to the compiled artifact (or at least a
   canonical `html → geml` / `md → geml` path) land back in source without
   corruption, losslessly where the constructs overlap.
7. **Stop the conversion data loss:** preserve thematic breaks and raw HTML
   through `md → geml` (as a real construct or a faithfully-roundtrippable raw
   block), and add the reverse direction.

### P2 — Scope discipline and honest positioning

8. **Re-scope `.gemlhistory`.** Spin it out of the core pitch; lean on git where
   git exists; keep it only if a crisp git-less audience is the explicit, stated
   target. Stop counting it among the headline differentiators.
9. **Fix the positioning.** Lead with "**the checkable source that compiles to
   great HTML**," not "replace md/html." Confront the XML comparison directly, and
   name the cold-start training-data reality rather than letting the AI-friendly
   claim imply zero-shot fluency that hasn't been measured.
10. **Honesty edits to README/COMPARISON.** State that diagrams don't render
    without a toolchain today; that build-time checking covers *ids*, not body
    *content*; and that the "renders as" examples are produced by an external
    renderer. Credibility with both of our communities depends on these.

## Part 6 — A scorecard we would both sign

| Criterion | Today | Bar to clear | Owner of the concern |
|---|---|---|---|
| Single defined parse (no ambiguity) | ✗ draft spec, regex parser | normative suite + 2nd implementation agrees | MacFarlane |
| Lists & emphasis pinned down | ✗ | explicit stated algorithm + examples | MacFarlane |
| Compiles to self-contained interactive HTML | ✗ none | ships, excellent, bundles renderers | Shihipar |
| Compiles to Markdown / PDF | ✗ | ships | both |
| Diagrams/charts render to pictures by default | ✗ source text only | bundled renderers | Shihipar |

| Agent valid-parse rate (with short skill) | unmeasured | high-90s, published | Shihipar |
| Fence nesting is local/safe | ✗ global depth | ≥-length or named close | both |
| Formulas are legible, not stringly-typed | ✗ in attributes | own body lines | both |
| Inline spans / definition lists / declarable types | ✗ | shipped | MacFarlane |
| Round-trip editing | ✗ | lossless where constructs overlap | Shihipar |
| Lossless, reversible Markdown conversion | ✗ lossy one-way | reversible | MacFarlane |
| Scope honest (history, "renders", checking boundary) | overclaims | corrected | both |

When most of the **P0** rows turn green, you will not need to convince either of
us — the conformance suite will satisfy MacFarlane and the artifacts will satisfy
Shihipar. That is the bar.

## Closing

GEML is a genuinely good idea carried about 60% of the way. Its bets — a single
checkable primitive, an AST-first model, references that fail loudly — are the
right ones, and they descend from the best parts of Djot, Pandoc, and the
hard-won CommonMark lessons. What holds it back is the same gap on both of our
axes: it has *described* a rigorous, expressive format without yet *building* the
two things that would make the description true — a normative specification that
guarantees one parse, and a compiler that turns the checkable source into the rich
artifact a human can actually use.

Do those two things, adopt the source-that-compiles-to-HTML framing that
reconciles our two worldviews, and trim the scope creep that distracts from the
core — and GEML stops being a clever format we admire and becomes one we
recommend. We would both like to get there. The work between here and there is
clear, finite, and worth doing.
